": "<br/>Normal users with no special permissions are only allowed to use the <b>!play<\/b> command to add songs to the queue by default. <br\/> They can also use other commands that don't affect the playing music in any way. Example: <b>!queue<\/b> and <b>!lyrics<\/b>. <br\/> <br\/> However, <b>Normal users can access ALL music commands when they are alone with the bot in the voice channel<\/b>. <br\/>This is because their commands would not affect anyone but themselves. <br\/> <br\/>For more information about users their command permissions, refer to the <b>>Permissions<\/b> section in this FAQ. <br\/>",
