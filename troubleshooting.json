		"Rythm left the voice channel after 2 minutes": "<br\/> For performance reasons, Rythm leaves after 2 minutes of it being alone in a voice channel. <br\/> This helps Rhythm save resources while no one is listening to it and keeps the music quality <br\/> consistent for all users at any given time! <br\/> <br\/> Don't worry though, as long as you are in a voice channel, just type <b>!summon<\/b> to make Rythm join your channel!",
