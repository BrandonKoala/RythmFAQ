		"When adding Rythm I can't see my server on the list": "<br\/> You need to have a role with “<b>Administrator<\/b>” or “<b>Manage server<\/b>” permissions to be able to add a Bot (Rythm) to a <b>Discord Server<\/b>. <br\/> <br\/> If you have the right permissions and <b>still can’t see<\/b> your server in the list, make sure you’re <b>logged in<\/b> into the correct <b>discord account<\/b> in your <b>web browser<\/b>. <br\/> ",
		
		"Rythm left the voice channel after 2 minutes": "<br\/> For performance reasons, Rythm leaves after 2 minutes of it being alone in a voice channel. <br\/> This helps Rhythm save resources while no one is listening to it and keeps the music quality <br\/> consistent for all users at any given time! <br\/> <br\/> Don't worry though, as long as you are in a voice channel, just type <b>!summon<\/b> to make Rythm join your channel!",
		
		"Rythm messages come out blank": "<\/br> Rythm uses something called rich embeds for the messages, which is an option that <b>might be disabled<\/b> on your client. Make sure to <b>enable<\/b> it! <br\/> <br\/> To do so: <br\/> <br\/> Go to your <b>discord settings<\/b> > click on \"<b>Text & Images<\/b>\"\r\n > <b>Enable<\/b> \"Show website preview info from links pasted into chat\u201D\r\n. <br\/> <br\/> <img src=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dvmYgs9.png\" alt=\"Mountain View\" style=\"width:500px;height:330px;\" >\r\n",
		
		"Rythm does not respond to commands": "<br\/> If Rhythm isn’t responding to commands, try the following: <br\/> <br\/> <br\/> \u2022 <b>Make sure you’re using the right Rhythm prefix<\/b>. You can see the current prefix <br\/> for rhythm by Mentioning the bot.<u>Example<\/u>: <b>@Rythm#3722<\/b> <br\/> <br\/> Mentioning the bot won't work if the channel you're using is <b>blacklisted<\/b>.<br\/> When you mention the bot, do it in a channel the bot can read and do commands in. <br\/> <br\/> <br\/> \u2022 <b>Make sure the bot has permissions to send messages in the text channel.<\/b> <br\/> You can give “<b>Administrator<\/b>” permissions to the bot to make this easier. <br\/> <br\/> <br\/> \u2022 <b>Change Server region<\/b>. If none of the above work, you can try changing <br\/> the Server Region in order to fix the issue. Any other should work, although a USA <br\/> region is recommended for better Bot performance.",
