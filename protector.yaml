Basics:
    How do I control what users can use Protector commands?: |
        <br/> All the protector commands rely on the standard Discord permissions system.
        <br/> If a user has the Ban Members Discord permission, they can use the ban command. The same goes for kick, mute. etc.
    How is the data for -history created?: |
        <br/> All data in the history command for a user is global. If a user advertises on any server and Protector removes it, it will up the count.
        <br/> In the same way if a user gets banned from any server this will up the ban count for the user in their history.
    Is the mute role a sticky role?: |
        <br/> Short answer: <b>Yes</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> Long answer: The mute role is sticky and will be re-applied to the user instantly if they leave and re-join.
